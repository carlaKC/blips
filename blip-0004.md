## Abstract

HTLC endorsement signaling is a [proposed](https://github.com/lightning/bolts/pull/1071) 
component of a [hybrid approach](https://research.chaincode.com/2022/11/15/unjamming-lightning) 
to addressing [channel jamming attacks](https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/channel-jamming-attacks) 
against the Lightning Network. This bLIP outlines a proposal to deploy an 
experimental endorsement TLV to the network to provide real world data to 
inform specification of reputation algorithms.

## Specification

Experiment Parameters, expressed as unix time (seconds):
* `experiment_start`: TODO: set once feature bit is widely deployed
* `experiment_end`: 1767225600

### Adding an HTLC: `update_add_htlc`:

1. `tlv_stream`: `update_add_htlc_tlvs`
    1. type: 106823(`endorsed`)
    2. data:
        * [`byte`:`endorsed`]

The 3 least significant bits of the endorsement TLV are used to represent an
endorsement value. A HTLC is considered to be endorsed if it is received
with `endorsed`=7 and unendorsed if `endorsed=0`.

Sender:
* If the current time is less than `experiment_end`:
  * if it is the original source of the HTLC:
    * if the current time is greater than or equal to `experiment_start`:
      * if it does not expect immediate fulfillment upon receipt by the 
        final destination: 
        * SHOULD set `endorsed` to `0`.
      * otherwise:  
        * SHOULD set `endorsed` to `7`.
    * otherwise:
      * SHOULD set `endorsed` to `0`
    * MAY choose to set `endorsed` to `0` for some percentage of payments to 
      prevent leaking its identity as the original sender.

Receiver:
* If the current time is less than `experiment_end`:
  * if running an experimental reputation algorithm:
    * SHOULD set `endorsed` at its discretion.
  * otherwise: 
    * if `endorsed`=7 in the incoming `update_add_htlc`:
        * SHOULD set `endorsed`=7 on its outgoing `update_add_htlc`
    * otherwise: 
      * SHOULD set `endorsed` to `0`.
* MUST NOT use the experimental `endorsed` field in resource allocation 
  decisions.

## Deployment and Deprecation

### Deployment 

Forwarding nodes can upgrade and begin to set `endorsed` signals immediately, 
as there is no privacy risk associated with propagating zero values. Feature 
bit signaling and a flag day are used to allow senders to set `endorsed` to `7`
without leaking their identity as the original sender of the HTLC.

1. Nodes on the network upgrade to support sending and forwarding zero value 
  `endorsed` signals.
2. Choose a `experiment_start` parameter based on deployment of the 
  `htlc_endorsed` signal on the network.
3. After `experiment_start` has passed, sending nodes start to set `endorsed` 
   to `7` as described above.
4. When `experiment_end` is reached, sending node on the network stop setting 
   the experimental `endorsed` field and intermediate nodes will stop 
   relaying it, so the signal will cease to propagate through the network.

### Deprecation

If `endorsement` is merged to the BOLTs, the experimental field will naturally 
be deprecated when `experiment_end` is reached. 

1. Nodes on the network may freely use an endorsement signal defined by the 
   BOLTs, even if `experiment_end` has not yet been reached, as the experimental 
   signal described in this bLIP is distinct from one outlined in the BOLTs.
2. Once `experiment_end` has been reached, all nodes will stop relaying the 
   experimental signal.
3. In the next release, experimental code can safely be removed as it has been 
   deprecated across the network.

## Motivation

The emergent properties of network-wide changes to Lightning are difficult to 
fully grasp without gathering real world data. This bLIP outlines a lightweight
and reversible mechanism to assess various reputation algorithms in a read-only
setting so that we can direct further specification in an informed manner.

## Rationale

Endorsement signals are copied from the incoming `update_add_htlc` to allow 
positive signals to propagate through the network. Nodes wishing to participate
in active experimentation may set this signal according to their local 
reputation algorithm, and this signal will be passively propagated by the 
upgraded portion of the route. This experimental signal is used to observe 
the behavior of reputation algorithms under real-world conditions, but is not 
used to allocate resources so that the experiment does not impact payment 
traffic.

A flag day is included to mitigate privacy concerns that setting the 
endorsement signal on payments will expose the identity of the original sender.
Nodes participating in the experiment will signal the `htlc_endorsed` feature 
in their node announcement to help chose an appropriate `experiment_start`. 
Once a sufficient portion of the network is upgraded to relay these signals, the 
presence of positive endorsement does not expose the sender as the original 
source of the HTLC. Senders are also advised to only set a positive endorsement
signal for some percentage of payments to further protect sender privacy.

The `endorsed` TLV is encoded as a single `byte` rather than a boolean to allow
flexible experimentation. Three bits of information are used to represent 
endorsement to allow for the future possibility of experimentation that relies 
on a range of endorsement values. HTLCs that are not endorsed include a TLV 
with a zero value byte so that they can be distinguished from those with no 
endorsement signal, which can be filtered out of experimental data as null 
values.

This experiment is opened as a bLIP because it is not intended to be a 
permanent part of the lightning specification. If a BOLT with endorsement 
signaling is merged to the BOLTs, the two signals can be handled independently 
and the experimental signal described in this bLIP can be removed after the 
end of the experimental period.
