## Abstract

HTLC endorsement signaling is a [proposed](https://github.com/lightning/bolts/pull/1071) 
component of a [hybrid approach](https://research.chaincode.com/2022/11/15/unjamming-lightning) 
to addressing [channel jamming attacks](https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/channel-jamming-attacks) 
against the Lightning Network. This bLIP outlines a proposal to deploy an 
experimental endorsement TLV to the network to provide real world data to 
inform specification of reputation algorithms.

## Specification

Experiment Parameters:
* `experiment_start`: [TODO]
* `experiment_end`: [TODO]

### Adding an HTLC: `update_add_htlc`:

1. `tlv_stream`: `update_add_htlc_tlvs`
    1. type: 65555 (`endorsed`)
    2. data:
        * [`byte`:`endorsed`]

The 3 least significant bits of the endorsement TLV are used to represent a 
scalar endorsement value. A HTLC is considered to be endorsed if it is received
`endorsed`=7 and unendorsed otherwise.

Sender:
* If the current time is greater than or equal to `experiment_start` and less 
  than `experiment_end`:
  * if it is the original source of the HTLC:
    * if it does not expect immediate fulfillment upon receipt by the 
      final destination: 
      * SHOULD set `endorsed` to `0`.
    * otherwise:  
      * SHOULD set `endorsed` to `7`.
  * MAY choose to set `endorsed` to `0` for some percentage of payments to 
    prevent leaking its identity as the original sender.

Receiver:
* If the current time is less than `experiment_end`:
  * if running an experimental reputation algorithm:
    * SHOULD set `endorsed` at its discretion.
  * otherwise: 
    * if `endorsed`=7 in the incoming `update_add_htlc`
        * SHOULD set `endorsed`=7 on its outgoing `update_add_htlc`
    * otherwise: 
      * SHOULD set `endorsed` to `0`.

## Deployment and Deprecation

### Deployment 

Forwarding nodes can upgrade and being to set `endorsed` signals immediately, 
as there is no privacy risk associated with propagating zero values. Feature 
bit signaling and a flag day are used to allow senders to set `endorsed` to `1`
without leaking their identity as the original sender of the HTLC.

1. Nodes on the network upgrade to support forwarding `endorsed` signals. 
2. Choose a `experiment_start` parameter based on deployment of the 
  `htlc_endorsed` signal on the network.
3. After `experiment_start` has passed, sending nodes start to set `endorsed` 
   to `1` as described above.
4. When `experiment_end` is reached, sending node on the network stop setting 
   the experimental `endorsed` field and intermediate nodes will stop 
   relaying it, so the signal will cease to propagate through the network.

### Deprecation

If `endorsement` is merged to the BOLTs, the experimental signal can be
deprecated in favor of the protocol-range field. If it is not, the signal 
will simply expire when `experiment_end` is reached.

1. Upgrade to protocol-range field: 

  Once nodes are updated to use the protocol-range field, they can stop
  advertising the experimental `htlc_endorsed` feature bit.

  Sender:
  * MUST set the same value for experimental and protocol-range field.

  Receiver:
  * if the protocol-range TLV is present: 
    * MUST interpret its value as the `endorsed` signal for the HTLC.
    otherwise, if the experimental TLV is present: 
    * SHOULD interpret the experimental value as the `endorsed` signal 
      for the HTLC.

2. When `experiment_end` is reached, the experimental field can be deprecated, 
  and the TLV number / feature bit can be released into the available pool:
  Sender: 
  * MUST set the protocol-range field.
  * MUST NOT set the experimental range field.

  Receiver: 
  * MUST interpret the protocol-range field as the `endorsed` value for the HTLC.

## Motivation

The emergent properties of network-wide changes to Lightning are difficult to 
fully grasp without gathering real world data. This bLIP outlines a lightweight
and reversible mechanism to assess the impact of this change so that we can 
direct further specification in an informed manner.

## Rationale

Endorsement signals are copied from the incoming `update_add_htlc` to allow 
positive signals to propagate through the network. Nodes wishing to participate
in active experimentation may set this signal according to their local 
reputation algorithm, and this signal will be passively propagated by the 
remainder of the route that is simply copying incoming values. Three bits of 
information are used to represent endorsement to allow for the possibility of 
experimentation that relies on a range of endorsement values if required in 
the future.

A flag day is included to mitigate privacy concerns that setting the 
endorsement signal on payments will expose the identity of the original sender.
Nodes participating in the experiment will signal the `htlc_endorsed` feature 
in their node announcement to help chose an appropriate `experiment_start`. 
Once a sufficient portion of the network is upgraded to relay these signals, the 
presence of positive endorsement does not expose the sender as the original 
source of the HTLC. Senders are also advised to only set a positive endorsement
signal for some percentage of payments to further protect sender privacy.

The `endorsed` TLV is encoded as a single `byte` rather than a boolean to allow
flexible experimentation. HTLCs that are not endorsed include a TLV with a zero
value byte so that they can be distinguished from those with no endorsement 
signal, which can be filtered out of experimental data as null values.

This experiment is opened as a bLIP because it is not intended to be a 
permanent part of the lightning specification. Should endorsement signaling be 
accepted to the BOLTs, the network can cleanly upgrade by setting the same 
value for the protocol and experimental range TLV, and deprecate the 
experimental TLV.
